  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1 head cabbage</li>
      <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
      <li>1/2 cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
  </ul>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for 2 minutes. Remove cabbage from water and let cool. Remove 12 large leaves from cabbage; set aside. Chop remaining cabbage and place in the bottom of a large pot.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, combine lamb, rice, onion, parsley, allspice, cinnamon, pepper, and salt. Mix well. Place about 1/4 cup of meat mixture in the center of each cabbage leaf. Roll up, tucking in the sides, and place rolls on top of chopped cabbage in pot.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, combine tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, lemon juice, and sugar. Pour over cabbage rolls. Place a heatproof plate on top of rolls to keep them submerged in liquid.</li>
  <li>Cover pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is cooked through and rice is tender. Serve hot.</li>
